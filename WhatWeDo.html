        <h1>Fund the next big thing</h1>
        <p>Indiegogo's crowdfunding campaigns are where new and groundbreaking products take flight, sometimes long before they hit mainstream availability. With thousands of campaigns launching every week, there's great tech, design, and much more around every corner — often with limited-time perks and pricing for the earliest backers. Before it's everywhere, it's on Indiegogo.</p>

        <p>With Indiegogo, you have the opportunity to support entrepreneurs and new technology from the earliest stages of development. Be sure to evaluate every campaign closely and contribute at a level you can afford in the event that the team is unable to complete the project as planned.</p>
        <p>Browse campaigns, read the stories from the entrepreneurs themselves, evaluate the stage of development and any potential production risks — and then fund the projects that you want to help succeed.</p>

                <p>Many campaigns offer perks to say thanks to backers, in exchange for different contribution amounts. Perks can be objects, acknowledgement, a thank you, services, events or anything that does not violate our Terms of Use.</p>
                <p>Perks are listed on the right side of the Campaign page, under the "Back It" button. If you do not see any perks listed, the campaign owner may have decided not to offer any perks.</p>
